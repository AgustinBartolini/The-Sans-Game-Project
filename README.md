# The-Sans-Game-Project

My first game made in 28 hours during hollydays. First contact with backend and solved problem with SQL and PHP.

Instuction: Select your difficulty and press Start the button.
Now a timer is running and points been setted to 0.
Pass the mouse over the dog as many times as you can during the timer.
For each mouseover you get one point.

If you get the needed points you win and can save your score in a SQL data base.
You can check the top score users on the right side.

Â¡Enjoy!
